Hi,

There is two main files one is API.py which contains the complete API and the attached model and second is client.py from which i'm sending the image and vidoe data to the API after some processing at client side. 

There is one folder with the name of database which is actually our database in this project.
whatever image or video you will place in that database client will only send that to API for the predictions. You can change according to your need. But client file only pic the image of extension .jpg and the video of extension .mp4. For further processing we need to change the code.

Model (model.py) file is attached and some videos and pictures are also attached.

All latest libraries I have used.

Thanks!
